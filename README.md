### LLM

- Large Language Models are AI models trained on vast amounts of text data to understand and generate human-like text.

- They use transformer architectures (like GPT, BERT, etc.) to process and generate text.

- Applications: Text generation, summarization, translation, question answering, chatbots, and more.


# There are several frameworks and libraries for working with LLMs. 
**The most popular ones are:**

1- Hugging Face Transformers: A library that provides pre-trained models and tools for NLP tasks.

2- OpenAI API: Provides access to powerful LLMs like GPT-3 and GPT-4 via an API.

3- LangChain: A framework for building applications with LLMs, including chatbots and agents.
