### LLM

- Large Language Models are AI models trained on vast amounts of text data to understand and generate human-like text.

- They use transformer architectures (like GPT, BERT, etc.) to process and generate text.

- Applications: Text generation, summarization, translation, question answering, chatbots, and more.

# There are several frameworks and libraries for working with LLMs. 
**The most popular ones are:**

1- Hugging Face Transformers: A library that provides pre-trained models and tools for NLP tasks.

2- OpenAI API: Provides access to powerful LLMs like GPT-3 and GPT-4 via an API.

3- LangChain: A framework for building applications with LLMs, including chatbots and agents.

  **Fine-Tune a Model**
If you have a specific use case, you can fine-tune a pre-trained model on your own dataset.


# Steps for Fine-Tuning

## 1. Choose a Pre-Trained Model  
Select a model from a library like Hugging Face (e.g., `bert-base-uncased`, `gpt2`, etc.).  

**Example:**  
```python
from transformers import AutoModelForSequenceClassification, AutoTokenizer

model_name = "bert-base-uncased"
model = AutoModelForSequenceClassification.from_pretrained(model_name)
tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(model_name)
```
## 2. Prepare Your Dataset
Use tools like Hugging Face's datasets library to load and preprocess data.

### 3. Define the Training Setup
Use a framework like Hugging Face's Trainer or PyTorch's DataLoader to define the training process

**Example:**  
```python
from transformers import TrainingArguments, Trainer

training_args = TrainingArguments(
    output_dir="./results",
    evaluation_strategy="epoch",
    save_strategy="epoch",
    per_device_train_batch_size=8,
    per_device_eval_batch_size=8,
    num_train_epochs=3
)

trainer = Trainer(
    model=model,
    args=training_args,
    train_dataset=dataset["train"],
    eval_dataset=dataset["test"]
)

trainer.train()
```
